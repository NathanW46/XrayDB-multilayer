# About X-ray DB

Originally part of Larch (https://xraypy.github.io/xraylarch/), and then
part of Scikit-Beam (https://github.com/scikit-beam/scikit-beam), the
XrayDB now has a permanent home here at (https://github.com/xraypy/XrayDB).


The X-ray Scattering data from the Elam Tables was modified from code
originally written by Darren S. Dale.


Refined values for anomalous scattering factors have been provided directly
by Christopher T. Chantler.


The project has mostly been supported and maintained by Matt Newville.
Suggestions and conributions are most welcome.
