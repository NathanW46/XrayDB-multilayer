The files here generate a poster-sized Periodic Table of X-ray absorption
edges and emission lines using data from Elam, Ravel, and Sieber, Radiation
Physics and Chemistry 63 (2002).

The latex source file used is heavily derived from the periodic tables of
the elememts by Ivan Griffin in the tikZ example set
    http://texample.net/tikz/examples/periodic-table-of-chemical-elements/

Building the Xray Periodic Table
=================================

To generate the PDF, use:
   make

To generate without the QR code pointing to GSECARS, use:

   cp ptable_no_gse.tex ptable.tex
   make

This assumes two things:
   a) latex and a reasonably modern version of the
      TikZ package are installed.
   b) that either the atomic data has been generated into atoms.tex
      or that Python, and the xraydb module are installed, so that
      the gen_atoms.py script can be run to extract the data from
      the datatbase and write out latex paragraphs for each element
      into the file atoms.tex with:

          python gen_atoms.py > atoms.tex
