The files here generate a poster-sized Periodic Table of X-ray absorption
edges and emission lines using data from Elam, Ravel, and Sieber, Radiation
Physics and Chemistry 63 (2002).

The latex source file used is heavily derived from the periodic tables of
the elememts by Ivan Griffin in the tikZ example set
    http://texample.net/tikz/examples/periodic-table-of-chemical-elements/

Building the Xray Periodic Table
=================================

To generate the PDF, use:
   make

This assumes two things:
   a) latex and a reasonably modern version of the TikZ package are installed.
   b) that either the atomic data has been or python, and the xraydb module
      are installed.   This holds the data from Elam, et al.  The gen_atoms.py
      script uses this to extract the data and write out latex paragraphs
      for each element into the file atoms.tex.

          python gen_atoms.py > atoms.tex

The PDF is generated with

   pdflatex ptable_xray
