Installation
=====================================

The X-ray database is held in the SQLite3 file ``xraydb.sqlite``.  For
direct use with SQLite, this file is all you need.



To install the XrayDB Python module, use::

   pip install xraydb

If you are using Anaconda Python, you can also install with::

   conda install -c gsecars xraydb

Finally, you can download the source directory from Github and
do the following::

   cd python
   python setup.py install

Depending on your system and Python installation, you may need
administrative privileges to install any python library.  For many linux
and Mac OS X systems, you may need to use `sudo`.

.. Note:: The Python module supports Python 3.5 and above.


To work with the data sources or to add or modify data in the XrayDB, you
will want to clone or download the full source code kit from github.
