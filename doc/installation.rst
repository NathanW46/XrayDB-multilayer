Installation
=====================================

The X-ray database is held in the SQLite3 file ``xraydb.sqlite``.  For
direct use with SQLite, this file is all you need.


Python
--------

To install the Python module, do::

   cd python
   python setup.py install

Depending on your system and Python installation, you may need
administrative privileges to install any python library.  For many linux
and Mac OS X systems, you may need to use `sudo`.
